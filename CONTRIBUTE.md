### Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Rofi themes repository! To maintain consistency and organization, please follow these guidelines when contributing themes.

#### Theme Structure

Each theme should be organized within a specific folder structure as follows:

```
themes/
    theme_name/
        themes/
            theme.rasi
        scripts/
            script1
            script2
```

- All names should be in lowercase to ensure consistency.
- Inside the theme folder, there should be two subfolders: `themes` and `scripts`.
- The `themes` folder contains the Rofi theme file (usually named `theme.rasi`).
- The `scripts` folder contains any associated scripts required for the theme.

#### Note:

- Please ensure that your theme follows our naming conventions and folder structure to maintain consistency across all themes.
- If you're updating an existing theme, make sure to follow the same process but only modify the necessary files within the appropriate theme folder.
- By following these guidelines, you'll help us maintain a well-organized and consistent collection of Rofi themes. Thank you for your contribution!
